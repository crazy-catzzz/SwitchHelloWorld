# How to build
To setup your system for building Nintendo Switch homebrew, refer to [WerWolv's tutorial on how to start developing Nintendo Switch homebrew apps](https://gbatemp.net/threads/tutorial-switch-homebrew-development.507284/).

Once your setup is done, clone this repository and run the `make` command inside the folder you cloned to.

Check the `out` folder to find your `.nro` file.
